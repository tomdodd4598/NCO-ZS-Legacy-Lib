# NCO-ZS-Legacy-Lib
An API for the addition of NuclearCraft: Overhauled fission isotopes and fuels, built to support pre-existing script addons.
New script addons should use NCO's built-in CraftTweaker support to reduce the use of item IDs!
An example of a script addon using this can be found [here!](https://github.com/turbodiesel4598/NuclearCraft/blob/1.12.2o/run/resources/nuclearcraft/addons/AddonTest-2.0/scripts/NCOLegacyLibSetup.zs)
